            Properties of Ice cream
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Texture:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ice cream should have a <b>smooth, creamy texture</b>, which is achieved through proper churning and the<br> incorporation of air (overrun).
        </p>
        <h3>
            Temperature:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Typically served at around -10 to -20<sup>o</sup>C (14 to -4<sup>o</sup>F), ice cream needs to remain cold to maintain its  <br>structure and avoidmelting.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Flavor:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ice cream can have a wide variety of flavors, influenced by the base ingredients <ins>(like cream, milk, and<br> sugar) </ins>and additional flavorings (fruits, chocolate, nuts, etc.).
        </p>
        <h3>
            Sweetness:
        </h3>
        <p>
            The sugar content not only sweetens but also affects the <strong>Freezing</strong> point, helping to create a softer texture.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Fat Content:
        </h3>
        <p>
            The fat in ice cream <small>(from cream or milk)</small> contributes to <i>creaminess and richness</i>. Higher fat content<br> generally results in a smoother texture.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Stability:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ingredients like stabilizers (e.g., guar gum, carrageenan) help prevent ice crystal formation, ensuring a consistent texture.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Mouthfeel:
        </h3>
        <p>
            The sensation of ice cream in the mouth is influenced by its<mark> fat content, temperature, and air<br> incorporation</mark>, all contributing to its creaminess.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Melting Rate:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ice cream's melting rate can vary based on its ingredients, particularly fat and air content, affecting how<br> it feels when consumed.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Serving and Storage:
        </h3>
        <p>
            <del> storage is crucial;</del> Ice cream should be kept at a consistent temperature to prevent freezer burn and maintain quality.
        </p>
